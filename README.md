Use Laravel's built-in ORM classes to query cloud resources with [Steampipe](https://hub.steampipe.io), an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

## üöÄ Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require renoki-co/laravel-steampipe
```

In your `config/database.php`, add a new driver:

```php
'connections' => [

    'steampipe' => [
        'driver' => 'steampipe',
        'binary' => env('STEAMPIPE_BINARY', 'steampipe'),
    ],

],
```

You can define the Steampipe binary path with `STEAMPIPE_BINARY`.

## üôå Usage

Steampipe is multi-vendor, multi-plugin. This means that you can interact with cloud APIs just like yo would do with Postgres. You would want to create a model for the "tables" you would want to access the cloud APIs through.

For example, let's make a `AwsRegion` model for the [`aws_region` table](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_region). Make sure you have [installed the AWS plugin for Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/docs).

```bash
php artisan steampipe:make:model aws_region
```

**Please observe that the models are created from the table in singular, `aws_region`. Usually, in Laravel you would have created the model class name directly. To break even and make the generation command easier, you should pass the table name instead of a class name.**

The command will create for you an `app/Steampipe/Aws/AwsRegion.php` file where you can access the model:

```php
use App\Steampipe\Aws\AwsRegion;

foreach (AwsRegion::all() as $region) {
    //
}
```

## Generation

You may generate as many models as you need. The convention is that when creating a table, it will always follow this pattern:

```
App\Steampipe\{Provider}\{TableNameStudlyCase};
```

This way, the models will know how to access the tables.

## üêõ Testing

``` bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
